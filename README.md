# Arnold Manzano

The adventure of puzzles and the thrill of bug-hunting animates me. I am an aspiring software developer motivated towards building solutions through code.

As an electronics engineer designing microchips for seven years, I thrived in an environment that demanded an innovative mind and team-centric values. Now, I want to fuse those experiences with my passion for programming to re-focus my energy and hunger for problem-solving and continuous learning.
